SmartTurn,"SmartTurn, a proven leader in on-demand inventory and warehouse management solutions, increases the visibility and control of inventory. Designed for quick implementation, ease-of-use, and real-time inventory accuracy, SmartTurn(TM) Inventory and Warehouse Management System provides immediate information on the quantity, location, and status of every inventory item at anytime, anywhere, eliminating costly paperwork errors and streamlining operations. From multiple warehouse locations to individual stockrooms, SmartTurn helps companies maintain a competitive advantage by reducing inventory costs, improving productivity, and increasing customer satisfaction. Only SmartTurn helps companies of all sizes, across all industries know what inventory they have on-hand and where it is located, all in real-time.

SmartTurn was originally founded in 2004 as a division of Navis LLC. Navis is the world-wide leading provider of logistics systems for marine container terminal management, yard management, and logistics asset management systems. While working with Navis customers such as AP Moeller Terminals, Dubai Ports World, Wal-Mart, Coca Cola Bottling, Johnson & Johnson, PepBoys and other leading supply chain companies, it became apparent that vast number of small and medium sized companies who co-exist or partner in the global supply chain with these major players were in need of a system that addressed their needs. 
Out of this observation, SmartTurn was born with the mission of providing an inventory and warehouse management system that fit the requirements of the small to medium supply chain player, delivered it within a cost and risk profile which matches their world, yet still has the flexibility, functionality and power to address even large high volume facilities.

Because SmartTurn's solutions require only a browser and an internet connection, our customers have been able to avoid the cost and hassle associated with the IT infrastructure, personnel, maintenance, and other hidden ownership costs of traditional installed software systems. While avoiding these hidden total cost of ownership (TCO) issues associated with traditional software, SmartTurn customers have found remarkable ways to corral their inventory views across their supply chain. Our customers also seamlessly integrate SmartTurn with existing applications such as QuickBooks, Peach Tree, Great Plains and other purchase order and sales order systems, creating an immediate leap in value to their customers.

From the smallest warehouse or stockroom, to large warehousing and distribution operations, the flexibility of SmartTurn's system allows a customer to automate inventory operations to work efficiently, quickly and error-free. The resulting global inventory view and accurate warehouse practices can service all other areas of logistics that affect the health of their business.
