    "analysis": "Score: 9/10\nExplanation: Stanza appears to be a platform that enables companies to manage their hourly workforce more efficiently. Given the nature of their service in managing hourly workers, there is a high likelihood that they would require data on people's work experience, job history, and possibly compensation. This aligns well with Aviato.co's product offering of data API for people profiles, especially for tech workers.\nVerdict: Yes",
