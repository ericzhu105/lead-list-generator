    "analysis": "Score: 9/10\nExplanation: Stanza appears to be a platform that enables companies to manage their hourly workforce more efficiently. Given the nature of their service in managing hourly workers, there is a high likelihood that they would require data on people's work experience, job history, and possibly compensation.
